        This page logs Cobalt caption settings variables.
        If your device does not support toggling captions or high contrast text settings at a platform level, these tests may be ignored.
        When system caption settings changed, Cobalt variables should changed accordingly and certain events should be fired.

        When "High Contrast Text" option in system settings is toggled,
        you should be able to monitor the variable change in the regular log and event monitor with "[High Contrast Text] has changed".

        When "Caption Display" option in system settings is toggled,
        you should be able to monitor the variable change in the regular log and event monitor with "[System Caption Settings] has changed".
