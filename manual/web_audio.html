          This page tests that WebAudio plays sounds correctly, and that the
          platform is able to play sounds using WebAudio while a video is
          playing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pressing any of the required 4 directional navigation keys (Up, Down,
          Left, Right) should result in a sound being played.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pressing Enter, Play, or Play/Pause should result in the video
          toggling between pausing and playing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The WebAudio navigation sounds should play properly on top of the
          video's sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same test sound is used for every key event. For Cobalt devices,
          this test will use a WAV file. Otherwise, MP3 is used.
